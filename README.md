For this assignment, a dataset is analyzed and displayed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.<br>
<br>
Rendering Table: <br>
Code is deployed that:
<li>Produces a table without error</li>
<li>Table includes all columns</li>
<li>Clear table before rendering again</li>
<li>Table rendered with filtered data</li>

<br>

Filtering Data: <br>
Additionally, the code allows for:
<li>Event handler calls a function to filter the data</li>
<li>Successfully grabs in the input value</li>
<li>Correctly uses the filter method to get the new table data based off the input</li>
<li>Prevents the page from reloading using D3</li> 

<br>
 To further demonstrate the skills learned,  two web pages were created. The first, allows for searching based on a date entered. The second, allows for searching based on date, along with city, state, country, and shape.
